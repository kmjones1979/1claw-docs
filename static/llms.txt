# 1claw

> 1claw is a cloud-hosted Hardware Security Module (HSM) secrets manager that lets humans grant AI agents scoped, audited, revocable access to secrets — without ever exposing raw credentials to the agent.

## What 1claw does

1claw stores API keys, tokens, and other secrets inside a cloud HSM. Humans control which agents can access which secrets, with what permissions, and for how long. Agents authenticate with 1claw and receive secrets at runtime — they never hold secrets in their own environment or context window.

## Bi-directional Human/Agent Access

Both humans and agents are first-class principals. Either can create vaults, store secrets, and share access with the other.

- **Humans** create vaults, store secrets, register agents, grant agents scoped access via policies, view audit logs, monitor billing.
- **Agents** can also create their own vaults, store secrets they discover or generate, and share those vaults back with their human creator or other org members. When an agent creates a vault, its human creator automatically gets full access.
- **Same REST API** at `api.1claw.xyz` — both humans and agents authenticate with JWTs. The `created_by_type` field (`user` or `agent`) on vaults, secrets, and policies tracks who created each resource.

### Security guardrails

- Agents can only create/update/delete policies on vaults they own — they cannot modify policies on human-created vaults.
- Auto-share ensures humans always have visibility into agent-created resources.
- All resources are org-scoped; agents cannot reach outside their organization.
- Every action is audit-logged with actor type and identity.

## MCP Server

1claw provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives AI agents (Claude, Cursor, GPT) just-in-time access to vault secrets.

- **Hosted** at `mcp.1claw.xyz` — no installation needed; authenticate with `Authorization` and `X-Vault-ID` headers.
- **Local (stdio)** — run via Claude Desktop or Cursor with agent token and vault ID as env vars.
- **10 tools**: `list_secrets`, `get_secret`, `put_secret`, `delete_secret`, `describe_secret`, `rotate_and_store`, `get_env_bundle`, `create_vault`, `list_vaults`, `grant_access`.
- **Resource**: `vault://secrets` — browsable listing of all secret paths.
- Secrets are fetched just-in-time, never cached, never logged.
- Agents can create vaults (`create_vault`), discover available vaults (`list_vaults`), and share access with humans or other agents (`grant_access`).

## Billing & Usage

- **Free tier**: 1,000 API requests/month per organization.
- **Pay-per-use**: x402 micropayments on Base (EIP-155:8453) after free tier.
- **Pricing**: Read secret $0.001, write $0.005, share $0.002, audit $0.0005.
- Usage is tracked across dashboard, SDK, and MCP — all count against the same quota.

## Web dashboard

At [1claw.xyz](https://1claw.xyz) you sign in (email/password or Google), then use the sidebar: **Dashboard**, **Vaults**, **Agents**, **Sharing**, **Audit Log**, **Security**, **API Keys**, **Billing**, **Team**. Create vaults and secrets under Vaults; register agents under Agents; manage members under Team; view usage under Billing.

## Core concepts

- **Vault** — A container for secrets; each vault has its own HSM-backed key (KEK). Both humans and agents can create vaults. Agent-created vaults are automatically shared with the agent's human creator.
- **Secret** — An encrypted credential stored in the vault (API key, token, password, certificate, etc.) at a path (e.g. `passwords/one`, `api-keys/stripe`).
- **Agent** — A registered AI entity (Claude, GPT, custom bot, MCP server) that receives an API key and can be granted access via policies. Agents are first-class principals that can create vaults, store secrets, and share access.
- **Policy (grant)** — Links a principal (user or agent) to secret path patterns with permissions (read, write, delete, etc.) and optional conditions/expiry.
- **Principal type** — Every creator is tracked with a `created_by_type` of `user` or `agent`, matching the JWT `sub` claim format (`user:UUID` or `agent:UUID`).
- **HSM** — Hardware Security Module; in production 1claw uses Google Cloud KMS. DEKs wrap secrets; KEKs wrap DEKs and never leave the HSM.
- **Human auth** — Email/password or Google OAuth → JWT. Personal API keys (`1ck_`) also get a JWT.
- **Agent auth** — Agent API key (`ocv_`) exchanged for a short-lived JWT via `POST /v1/auth/agent-token`.
