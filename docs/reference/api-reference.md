# API reference

The canonical API spec is the **OpenAPI 3.1** document shipped with the project. It defines all paths, request/response schemas, and error shapes.

## Base URL

- **Production:** `https://api.1claw.xyz`
- **Dashboard proxy:** `https://1claw.xyz/api` (proxies to the same API)

All endpoints are under **/v1**.

## Notes

- The API expects `email` and `password` for `/v1/auth/token` (not `username`).
- Secret paths are wildcard routes — e.g. `api-keys/openai`, `config/prod/db`.
- Middleware layers applied to authenticated routes: **auth → IP filter → usage tracking**.
- Crypto proxy routes additionally require the `crypto_proxy_enabled` claim in the JWT.
- The **x402 middleware** runs on all routes and can gate access behind payment for configured endpoints.
- See [Authentication](/docs/human-api/authentication) for details on obtaining and refreshing JWTs.
