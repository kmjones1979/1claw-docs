# Changelog

For detailed release history, see the [1clawAI GitHub](https://github.com/1clawAI) repositories.

## API stability

The **/v1** API is stable. Breaking changes would be accompanied by a new version prefix or clear deprecation notices. New optional fields or endpoints are added in a backward-compatible way.

## 2026-02 (latest)

### Admin user management

- **New:** `DELETE /v1/admin/users/:user_id` — platform admins can delete users. Cascades: delete share links created by the user, clear `agents.created_by`, then delete the user (device_auth_codes and user_api_keys CASCADE in DB). Cannot delete self or the last owner of the platform org.
- **New:** `scripts/cleanup-test-users.sh` — removes test users by display name. Auth via `ONECLAW_TOKEN` or `ADMIN_EMAIL` + `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Use `--dry-run` to list only.

### Security audit hardening

- **New:** Per-agent transaction guardrails — `tx_allowed_chains`, `tx_to_allowlist`, `tx_max_value_eth`, `tx_daily_limit_eth` enforced before signing.
- **New:** Audit hash chain — each event stores `prev_event_id` and SHA-256 `integrity_hash` for tamper detection.
- **New:** x402 payment replay protection — payment proofs deduplicated via SHA-256 before facilitator verification.
- **New:** Authorization enforcement on `delete_secret`, `list_secrets`, and `list_versions` (policy check, not just org membership).
- **Improved:** CORS defaults to `https://1claw.xyz` in production (no more permissive `Any` fallback).
- **Improved:** CSP removes `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` from `script-src`.
- **Improved:** Global rate limiting middleware applied to all API routes.
- **Improved:** Dependency overrides for `minimatch`, `ajv`, `hono` to address known CVEs.

### Dashboard UX — CopyableId

- **New:** One-click copy for every UUID, path, and identifier across the dashboard. Vault IDs, agent IDs, principal IDs, audit actor/resource IDs, API key prefixes, secret paths, and user/org IDs in the sidebar — all clickable with tooltip confirmation.

### Quota exemption for platform admin orgs

- **New:** `CallerIdentity.quota_exempt` flag resolved at authentication time. Platform admin org (and its agents) bypasses all billing checks. Cleaner than per-route overrides — single source of truth in auth middleware.

### Policy UI improvements

- **New:** Vault selector dropdown on Create Access Policy page — pick any vault, not just the one in the URL.
- **New:** Agent principal picker — select from existing agents or type a custom agent ID.
- **New:** Edit policy dialog — update permissions, conditions (JSON), and expiry on existing policies.
- **New:** Delete policy from the policies list page.

### Agent integration guide

- **New:** Agent detail page in the dashboard now includes a tabbed integration guide with copy-paste code snippets for TypeScript SDK, Python, curl, and MCP configuration.

### PolyForm Noncommercial License

- All repositories now include the [PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0).

### Organization migration

- All repositories moved to the [1clawAI](https://github.com/1clawAI) GitHub organization.

### Email notifications

- **New:** Transactional emails via [Resend](https://resend.com) for account and security events.
- Welcome email on signup (email/password and Google OAuth).
- Share invite email when a secret is shared by email.
- Share access notification to the creator when a shared secret is accessed.
- Password change confirmation email.
- API key creation notification email.
- Emails are fire-and-forget (non-blocking) and silently skipped when no `RESEND_API_KEY` is configured.

### Sharing & invite-by-email

- **New:** `external_email` share type — share secrets with users who don't have accounts yet.
- **New:** Claim-on-login — pending email shares are automatically claimed when the recipient signs up or logs in.
- **New:** Share access notifications — creators are emailed each time a shared secret is accessed.
- **New:** `POST /v1/auth/signup` — self-service account registration via email/password.

### SDK rewrite (`@1claw/sdk` v0.2.0)

- **New:** Full API parity — typed methods for all 42+ REST API endpoints.
- Resource modules: `vault`, `secrets`, `access`, `agents`, `sharing`, `auth`, `apiKeys`, `billing`, `audit`, `org`.
- `createClient()` factory with auto-authentication (API key or agent credentials).
- `{ data, error, meta }` response envelope on every method.
- Typed error hierarchy: `AuthError`, `PaymentRequiredError`, `NotFoundError`, `RateLimitError`, etc.
- x402 auto-payment support with configurable `maxAutoPayUsd`.
- MCP tool layer: `McpHandler` and `getMcpToolDefinitions()` for AI agent frameworks.
- `auth.signup()` for programmatic account creation.
- `sharing.create()` with email support for invite-by-email.

### Examples repository

- **New:** `examples/basic/` — TypeScript scripts for vault CRUD, secrets, billing, signup, and email sharing.
- **New:** `examples/nextjs-agent-secret/` — Next.js 14 app with Claude AI agent accessing vault secrets.

### MCP server (`@1claw/mcp`)

- **New:** MCP server for AI agent access to secrets via the Model Context Protocol.
- 7 tools: `list_secrets`, `get_secret`, `put_secret`, `delete_secret`, `describe_secret`, `rotate_and_store`, `get_env_bundle`.
- Browsable `vault://secrets` resource.
- **Dual transport:** Local stdio mode (Claude Desktop, Cursor) and hosted HTTP streaming mode (`mcp.1claw.xyz`).
- Per-session authentication in hosted mode — each connection gets its own vault client.
- Auto-deploy to Cloud Run via GitHub Actions.

### Billing & usage tracking

- **New:** Usage tracking middleware records every authenticated API request.
- **New:** Free tier — 1,000 requests/month per organization.
- **New:** x402 Payment Required responses when free tier is exhausted, with on-chain payment on Base (EIP-155:8453).
- **New:** Billing API — `GET /v1/billing/usage` (summary) and `GET /v1/billing/history` (event log).
- Unified billing across dashboard, SDK, and MCP — all count against the same quota.

### Vault API

- Added `POST /v1/agents/:agent_id/rotate-key` endpoint for agent key rotation.
- Added `GET /v1/billing/usage` and `GET /v1/billing/history` endpoints.
- Usage middleware tracks method, endpoint, principal, status code, and price per request.
- x402 middleware enforces free tier limits and returns payment-required responses.

### Infrastructure

- Cloud Run deployment for MCP server (`oneclaw-mcp`).
- Terraform resources for MCP service and domain mapping.
- GitHub Actions workflow for MCP auto-deploy.
- CI pipeline expanded: MCP type check, build, Docker image build and Trivy scan.

### Documentation

- **New:** Full MCP documentation section (overview, setup, tool reference, security, deployment).
- **New:** Billing & usage guide.
- **New:** Deploying updates guide.
- Updated intro, MCP integration guide, and changelog.
- Updated `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` with MCP and billing content.
