# Human API overview

The **Human API** is the full set of REST endpoints used by secret owners: create and manage vaults, store and retrieve secrets, define policies (grants), register and manage agents, view audit logs, and manage billing/usage. You use it with a **JWT** obtained via email/password, Google OAuth, or a personal API key.

## Base URL

- **Production:** `https://api.1claw.xyz` (or your Cloud Run URL, e.g. `https://oneclaw-vault-XXXX.run.app`)
- **Dashboard proxy:** The app at [1claw.xyz](https://1claw.xyz) proxies `/api/v1/*` to the same API, so from the browser the base is effectively `https://1claw.xyz/api`.

All endpoints are under the `/v1` prefix.

## Authentication

Every request (except health and public auth endpoints) must include:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

Ways to get an access token:

| Method | Endpoint | Request body |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Signup** | `POST /v1/auth/signup` | `{ "email", "password", "display_name?" }` |
| Email + password | `POST /v1/auth/token` | `{ "email", "password" }` |
| Google OAuth | `POST /v1/auth/google` | `{ "id_token" }` |
| Personal API key | `POST /v1/auth/api-key-token` | `{ "api_key" }` (e.g. `1ck_...`) |

See [Authentication](/docs/human-api/authentication) for details and response shape.

## Main areas

## Response and errors

- Success responses return JSON with the documented shape (or 204 No Content for deletes).
- Errors use **RFC 7807**-style JSON: `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`. See [Error codes](/docs/reference/error-codes) and [Human API errors](/docs/human-api/errors).
