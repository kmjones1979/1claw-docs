# Email Notifications

1Claw sends transactional email notifications for important security and account events. Emails are powered by [Resend](https://resend.com) and are sent asynchronously — they never block API responses.

## Notification events

| Event | Recipient | When |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **Welcome** | New user | Account created via email/password signup or Google OAuth |
| **Secret shared** | Share recipient | A secret is shared with them via email (`external_email` share) |
| **Shared secret accessed** | Share creator | Someone accesses a secret the user shared |
| **Password changed** | User | Password is successfully changed |
| **API key created** | User | A new personal API key is created on their account |

## Configuration

Email sending requires a Resend API key. Set these environment variables on the vault server:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Yes | — | Your Resend API key (`re_...`) |
| `ONECLAW_EMAIL_FROM` | No | `1Claw <noreply@1claw.xyz>` | Sender address |
| `ONECLAW_PUBLIC_URL` | No | `https://1claw.xyz` | Base URL for links in emails |

If `RESEND_API_KEY` is not set, email sending is silently skipped and a log message is emitted instead. This is useful for local development.

## Self-hosting

If you're self-hosting 1Claw:

1. Create a free [Resend](https://resend.com) account.
2. Add and verify your domain in Resend.
3. Create an API key and set `RESEND_API_KEY` in your environment.
4. Set `ONECLAW_EMAIL_FROM` to a sender address on your verified domain.
5. Set `ONECLAW_PUBLIC_URL` to your dashboard URL so email links work correctly.

## Email design

All emails use inline CSS for maximum email client compatibility. They follow a dark theme consistent with the 1Claw brand and include:

- Clear subject lines describing the event
- Action buttons linking to the dashboard
- Footer with support contact information
