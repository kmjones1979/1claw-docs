# Sharing Secrets

1Claw supports sharing individual secrets with other users, agents, or external collaborators via email. Shares are time-limited, access-counted, and can be revoked at any time.

## Share types

| `recipient_type`   | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `creator`          | Share back with the human who registered this agent (agents only, no ID needed) |
| `user`             | Direct share to an existing 1Claw user by ID                                    |
| `agent`            | Direct share to a registered agent by ID                                        |
| `external_email`   | Invite-by-email — the recipient doesn't need an account yet (humans only)       |
| `anyone_with_link` | Anyone with the share URL can access                                            |

## Create a share

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.1claw.xyz/v1/secrets/{secret_id}/share \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "recipient_type": "external_email",
    "email": "colleague@example.com",
    "expires_at": "2026-03-15T00:00:00Z",
    "max_access_count": 5
  }'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
import { createClient } from "@1claw/sdk";

const client = createClient({
  baseUrl: "https://api.1claw.xyz",
  apiKey: process.env.ONECLAW_API_KEY,
});

const { data: share } = await client.sharing.create(secretId, {
  recipient_type: "external_email",
  email: "colleague@example.com",
  expires_at: "2026-03-15T00:00:00Z",
  max_access_count: 5,
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Response:**

```json
{
    "id": "uuid",
    "share_url": "https://api.1claw.xyz/v1/share/uuid",
    "recipient_type": "external_email",
    "recipient_email": "colleague@example.com",
    "expires_at": "2026-03-15T00:00:00Z",
    "max_access_count": 5
}
```

## Agent-to-human sharing (creator)

The simplest way for an agent to share a secret back with the human who owns it:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.1claw.xyz/v1/secrets/{secret_id}/share \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "recipient_type": "creator",
    "expires_at": "2026-03-15T00:00:00Z",
    "max_access_count": 5
  }'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
const { data: share } = await client.sharing.create(secretId, {
  recipient_type: "creator",
  expires_at: "2026-03-15T00:00:00Z",
  max_access_count: 5,
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The backend resolves the agent's `created_by` field to identify the human. No user UUID or email needed. The human sees the share in their **Inbound** shares and accepts it.

**Via MCP:**

```
share_secret(secret_id: "...", recipient_type: "creator", expires_at: "2026-12-31T00:00:00Z")
```

## Invite-by-email flow

When a human shares with `recipient_type: "external_email"`:

1. A share record is created with the recipient's email.
2. The recipient receives an email notification with a link to sign in.
3. When the recipient signs up or logs in with that email, all pending shares are **automatically claimed** — they appear in the recipient's account.
4. The recipient can then access the shared secret through the API or dashboard.

Note: only humans can create email-based shares — agents are blocked from this type to prevent email spam.

## Access a share

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl https://api.1claw.xyz/v1/share/{share_id}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
const { data: secret } = await client.sharing.access(shareId);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Returns the decrypted secret value if the share is still valid (not expired, under access limit).

## Revoke a share

Only the creator can revoke:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.1claw.xyz/v1/share/{share_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
await client.sharing.revoke(shareId);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Email notifications

When a share is created with `external_email`, the recipient receives an email. The share creator also receives a notification each time the shared secret is accessed.

See [Email Notifications](/docs/guides/email-notifications) for the full list of automated emails.

## Security considerations

- Shares respect the `max_access_count` — once exhausted, the link is dead.
- Shares expire at `expires_at` — past that datetime, access is denied.
- Share creators are notified on each access.
- Revoked shares return 404 immediately.
- Optional: add a `passphrase` or `ip_allowlist` to the share for additional protection.
